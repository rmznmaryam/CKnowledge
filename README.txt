Summary:
this code produces different outputs based on the user's input. 
If the user did not input anything, the code assume they want to see 3 disks moving from tower 1 to tower 2. If the user only inputs one number, that number is the number of disks to be moved from tower 1 to 2.
Lastly, if the user inputs three numbers the first one is the number of disks, the second is the tower it is currently in, and the third is the destination tower. This is all completed by the tower function.
I was also able to use stderr as i used error messages to inform the user if a negative number of disks were inputted, or if the user's original and destination towers were the same.
